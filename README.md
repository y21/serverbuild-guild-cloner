# IMPORTANT
This will no longer be updated, as a config file is no longer needed for the base project. For the guild cloner, you probably want to check out [this](https://github.com/y21/serverbuild) repository.<br/>
The code on this repository is bad and there is pretty much no use case for this repo. I will (probably) not delete this project for the sake of keeping old projects archived instead of deleting them.

# serverbuild-guild-cloner
Lets you generate a json file for y21/serverbuild
Input your token in config.json and start the bot. Based on discord.js.

### Cloning procedure
If the websocket is connected to the discordapi, you can type `.guild-clone` in any channel of the guild that you want to clone. You'll see a verification message when it's done.
